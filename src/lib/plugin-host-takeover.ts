/**
 * Plugin Host Takeover
 *
 * The plugin SDK ships with a set of in-process stub implementations
 * (storage, event bus, context-menu registry) so plugin authors can
 * iterate against `npm run dev` in the starter template without the
 * host. When the host loads an external plugin bundle, the SDK's
 * stubs must be replaced with the host's real implementations so:
 *
 *   1. The runtime permission checks actually fire
 *      (`assertPermission('context-menu', ...)`, `assertPermission('storage', ...)`
 *      etc. are wired into the host's `pluginMenuRegistry.register` /
 *      `PluginStorageImpl.set` paths; the stubs don't enforce them).
 *   2. Cross-plugin state is shared (one global event bus, one
 *      Tauri-backed storage layer).
 *   3. Backend IPC is reachable.
 *
 * Design
 * ------
 * Each plugin bundle has its own SDK instance (the SDK is inlined
 * by the bundler). The host's job is to call `setHost({...})` on
 * the bundle's SDK right before firing a lifecycle hook, and to
 * call the returned `restore` once the hook settles. The
 * `runPluginLifecycleHook` helper here wires that up so the
 * existing `runLifecycleHook` call sites in the store and
 * `PluginPanelHost` get takeover for free.
 *
 * The host can't reach the bundle's SDK directly – it can only
 * talk to the IIFE's exported properties. That's why the plugin
 * template and samples re-export `setHost` from the SDK in their
 * entry file: the host reads `pluginModule.setHost` and calls it.
 * Plugins defined inline in the host (no `__pluginModule` field)
 * skip the takeover automatically – they import the host's real
 * implementations directly.

 * in-process stub.
 *
 * Concurrency: the SDK's `setHost` is stack-based (each call
 * gets a unique token; the returned `restore` matches by token

 * are safe – plugin A's `restore()` only pops A's layer, even

 * are no-ops because the host's real implementations were
 * imported directly under the same names.

 * triggers the health monitor: the plugin is flipped to
 * `unhealthy` in the store, `setPluginEnabled(id, false)` is
 * invoked to take it out of the registry, and a `lastError` is
 * recorded via `recordPluginError` for the diagnostics popup.
 * The host does NOT block waiting for the wedged hook – the
 * underlying `runLifecycleHook` promise keeps running in the
